# Master katuali configuration file template
# ------------------------------------------
#
# Having copied this file with the command:
#     katuali_config my_config.yaml
# it will be necessary to amend the `DATA:` dictionary in the first section below
# to define the dataset to be processed.
#
# The second section containing software locations should also be checked and
# amended if necessary.
#
# To run the predefined workflows: `all_fast_assm_polish`, `all_standard_assm_polish`
# `all_medaka_train_features` starting from fast5 input,
# nothing else need be done. If starting a workflow from basecall data
# (https://nanoporetech.github.io/katuali/examples.html#starting-from-existing-basecalls),
# basecalls should be placed under the basecalling folder as defined in the pipelines config section.
# For the all_fast_assm_polish pipeline for example, basecalls should be placed in 
# "{DATA}/guppy/basecalls.fastq"


####################
# Input data options

# .fast5 files can be under top-level folders named by a RUNID (these need not
# be actual run UUIDs). Fast5s should be in RUNID/reads.  The keys within this
# data dictionary are RUNIDs.
#
# REFERENCE is required for the medaka training workflows, and in general any
# time reads need to be aligned to a reference (e.g. for for subsampling)
#   
# MEDAKA_TRAIN_REGIONS and MEDAKA_EVAL_REGIONS define regions for
# training and evaluation within the medaka training workflow, and are
# otherwise not used. 
#
# GENOME_SIZE is required only in workflows using the canu or flye assembler.
# When a reference file is given, GENOME_SIZE will be calculated from it in
# the case that a value is not directly specified.
#
# In the example below we train from the "minion" run using "ecoli" and "yeast"
# contigs in the reference and evaluate on the "gridion" run using the contigs
# "ecoli", "yeast" and "na12878_chr21" in the reference.

    # Compute/cluster options

    # Location of scratch space on cluster nodes. This is currently only used for
    # medaka training where latency on an networked filesystem can significantly
    # slow things down. To have katuali copy medaka features to scratch space
    # before training set SCRATCH and optionally TMPSCRATCH.
    #
    # If TMPSCRATCH is given the resultant path will be:
    #     /SCRATCH/$USER/TMPSCRATCH
    # whereas if it is not given the resultant path will be:
    #    /SCRATCH/$USER/<generated unique name>
    #
    # TMPSCRATCH is useful in the case of restarting a training job on a node to
    # which features have already been copied; in this case, simply set TMPSCRATCH
    # to the directory under which the features were copied and katuali will skip
    # copying the data and use the existing data.

    # Note that katuali does not delete the data in scratch, so users must do this
    # manually.

    # about to run.  Note that if the file is not found, katuali will attempt to
